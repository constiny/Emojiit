## Background

> Originating on Japanese mobile phones in 1997, emoji became increasingly popular worldwide in the 2010s after being added to several mobile operating systems.

In 2020-01-29, the most recent version Emoji 13.0 was released with 117 new emojis which sum up to 3,304 emojis in total.

Although 3,000 doesn't seem like a big number, emojis have rich meanings and easily understood by people from different background. For instance, here is a example of behavior recommendation under COVID-19.

👑🦠            (Coronavirus)

* 🚫🤦          (Don't touch your face)
* 🚫🤧🤲        (Don't sneeze into hands)
* ✅🤧💪        (Do sneeze into your elbow)
* 🧼🖐⏲        (Wash your hands regularly)
* 🚇😷🛒        (Wearing a mask in public)
